# Bike Rental Analysis - Phase 1

This project is focused on exploring and analyzing bike rental data to understand rental patterns, trends, and potential influencing factors. The goal is to gain insights that can inform business decisions, optimize bike rental strategies, and improve overall service delivery.

## Project Overview

This analysis includes:
- Data exploration: understanding the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
- Data cleaning: handling missing values, outliers, and formatting inconsistencies.
- Feature engineering: creating additional features that may help improve analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): identifying trends, correlations, and insights from the data.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling null values, and addressing data inconsistencies.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new variables that can potentially influence bike rentals.
- **EDA**: Visualizing patterns in rental demand, weather effects, and other influencing factors.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you’ll need the following packages installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

Install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Bike_Rental_phase_1.ipynb
   ```
3. Run each cell in sequence to execute the code and reproduce the analysis.

## Data

This project uses a bike rental dataset (details on source and acquisition to be added if available). The dataset contains various attributes that may affect rental activity, such as:
- Date and time information
- Weather conditions
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Rental counts

## Analysis Outline

1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**: Overview of data, summary statistics, and column descriptions.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identification and handling of missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Adding columns for new potential features.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing the data to identify trends, seasonality, and other insights.

## Results

The analysis reveals key factors affecting bike rental demand and highlights opportunities for further analysis and potential predictive modeling.

## Future Work

In subsequent phases, we aim to:
- Develop predictive models to forecast bike rental demand.
- Experiment with different feature sets and model tuning.
- Evaluate model performance and refine based on results.
